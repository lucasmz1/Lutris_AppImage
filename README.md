# This is an unofficial AppImage for Lutris

# Installation
## Auto
1. Install [AM/AppMan](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM), it's a very good tool to install AppImages
2. This program isn't in AM's repo list, you'll have to added manually

`am extra contrarybaton60/Lutris-appimage lutris`

or

`appman contrarybaton60/Lutris-appimage lutris`

## Manual

Go to releases, download the latest build, make sure to set it executable.

# Untested/maybe broken things
- Wayland (it should work fine)
- "i386 libGL.so.1 missing (needed by opengl)" you should be able to install this lib with your distro's package manager until I find a way to fix this
